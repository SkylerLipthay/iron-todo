# iron-todo

This is a simple, complete example of serving a single page web app using Rust's [Iron](http://ironframework.io) server framework.

There will soon be a full tutorial to accompany this code!

## Execution

Clone this repository locally, then build and run the server.

```
git clone https://github.com/SkylerLipthay/iron-todo
cd iron-todo
cargo run
```

Point your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and get to organizing!
